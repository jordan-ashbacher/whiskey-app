Each whiskey in the series is named for something or someone special in the life of Dixon Dedman, 2XO's founder and master blender. This bourbon is named for Kiawah, an Island in South Carolina, located 25 miles southwest of Charleston. According to 2XO, this is Dedman's happy place where he goes with friends and family to relax. As for the whiskey, The Kiawah Blend is a mix of two bourbon mashbills, one with a 35% rye content and the other with a lower mark of 18%. The higher-rye portion, which makes up 60% of the blend, is double-barreled, finished for 9-12 months in new charred oak barrels with #3 and #4 char levels.
